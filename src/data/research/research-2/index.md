description: "Personalization in Federated Learning (FL) has been proven effective for incentivizing clients to participate in the training. However, personalization has been only studied at a coarse granularity where all the input instances of a client (heterogeneous or otherwise) only use its individual local model, despite it being limited to only that client's data. Flow explores instance-level personalization through dynamically making routing decisions between the local and the global model, with the aim of achieving superior personalized performance for a given instance. Besides, as cross-device FL deals with millions of resource-constrained client devices, we push towards stateless personalization where a client doesn't need to carry its personalized state across FL rounds.
